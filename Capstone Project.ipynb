    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will create a neural network that translates from English to German. You will use concepts from throughout this course, including building more flexible model architectures, freezing layers, data processing pipeline and sequence modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is peer-assessed. Within this notebook you will find instructions in each section for how to complete the project. Pay close attention to the instructions as the peer review will be carried out according to a grading rubric that checks key parts of the project instructions. Feel free to add extra cells into the notebook as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to submit\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have completed the Capstone project notebook, you will submit a pdf of the notebook for peer review. First ensure that the notebook has been fully executed from beginning to end, and all of the cell outputs are visible. This is important, as the grading rubric depends on the reviewer being able to view the outputs of your notebook. Save the notebook as a pdf (File -> Download as -> PDF via LaTeX). You should then submit this pdf for review.\n",

This token is a TensorFlow Variable that is learned in the training phase (unlike the pre-trained word embedding, which is frozen).\n",
